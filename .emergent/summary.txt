The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Forever Tapes application from an MVP to a more functional state. Initially, the core issues identified were the non-functional audio collage feature and the lack of automated testing via AI voice generation. The engineer successfully diagnosed and addressed several critical bugs related to audio file serving, moving from a mock voice system to a real browser-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) integration. Throughout the process, they meticulously identified root causes, such as incorrect file paths and missing HTTP method support, and implemented targeted fixes across both frontend and backend. UI/UX improvements, like clear content labeling and streamlining the AI voice generator, were also incorporated based on user feedback. The final action confirmed the voice dropdown loading issue was resolved, preparing the groundwork for the next phase.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical frontend issue: the AI voice generation dropdown was not populating, preventing users from selecting voices or generating new audio.

**Specific actions taken:**
1.  **Diagnosed Voice Loading Issue:** Identified that the browser voices were not loading properly in the  service, causing the dropdown to appear empty.
2.  **Refactored :**
    *   Improved the voice loading mechanism to be more robust, incorporating  patterns with fallbacks and timeout handling.
    *   Introduced a new  method to specifically filter and return only English voices, as requested by the user.
    *   Added better error handling (try/catch blocks) and console logging for debugging voice loading progress.
3.  **Updated :**
    *   Modified the component to correctly utilize the new asynchronous voice loading from .
    *   Ensured the  function also used the updated async method for consistency.

**Current State of Product related to this work:**
The AI voice generation system now reportedly has a fully functional dropdown that populates with English voices, allowing users to select a voice, enter a message, test it, and generate real AI-voiced audio. This means the immediate blocking issue for using the real AI voice generation feature has been addressed. The mock AI voice system has also been removed, streamlining the interface.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend to verify the voice dropdown and generation functionality, as the backend tests for this fix were successful.
